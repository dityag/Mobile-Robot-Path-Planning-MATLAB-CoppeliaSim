# How to use simulation using Matlab and CoppeliaSim

1. `git clone https://github.com/dityag/Mobile-Robot-Path-Planning-MATLAB-CoppeliaSim.git` on your workspace folder
2. Open Matlab `main.mlx` and CoppeliaSim `main.ttt` first
3. `Set Breakpoint` on the line after `2. Path Tracking` so that probabilistic path planning can appear

4. You can freely set your aiming point by moving the `disc`

5. Next, you can press `play simulation` in Matlab and CoppeliaSim and the robot will run according to the path that has been generated by the probabilistic roadmap.

## How to create a custom environment
1. Create a custom environment complete with properties as static obstacles and you can add dynamic obstacles such as people or robots moving in coppeliasim

2. Black for static obstacles in your environment and white for no obstacles. If the size of your environment in CoppeliaSim is 10x15 meters. Then you have to make the image editing application scala 1:100 or 1000x1500 pixels to adjust the image size in Matlab.
   You can do this using paint / coreldraw / photoshop.

3. Next, you can export the results in grayscale .jpg format.

4. You need to import the .jpg image into Matlab to match the coppeliasim environment
